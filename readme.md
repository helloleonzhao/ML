I have passed Machine Learning class taught by Prof. Andrew Ng at Coursera. 

Here's the copy of the certificate, https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/RZSV9CCQTBCW

I found a very similar curriculum at this repository, https://github.com/schneems/Octave

I created a previate branch and only posted my code after each assignment's due date.
